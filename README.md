# kgof
Linear-time kernel goodness-of-fit test

* When  reproducing the results, it will be necessary to modify the dictionary
  keys in `kgof.config` to have correct directories for various paths. If the
  keys are modified externally, then the same modifications need to be applied
  before plots can be generated by the provided Jupyter notebooks.

* When adding a new Kernel or new UnnormalizedDensity, use np.dot(X, Y) instead of 
  X.dot(Y). `autograd` cannot differentiate the latter.
