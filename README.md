Linear-time kernel goodness-of-fit test

* When  reproducing the results, it will be necessary to modify the dictionary
  keys in `kgof.config` to have correct directories for various paths. If the
  keys are modified externally, then the same modifications need to be applied
  before plots can be generated by the provided Jupyter notebooks.

* When adding a new Kernel or new `UnnormalizedDensity`, use `np.dot(X, Y)` instead of 
  `X.dot(Y)`. `autograd` cannot differentiate the latter. Also, do not use `x += ...`.
  Use `x = x + ..` instead.

* Note that current version of the test only works for cases where the domain
  is R^d (not even a bounded subset). This is due to the vanishing-boundary
  condition required to construct the Stein operator.

* The sub-module `kgof.intertst` depends on the linear-time two-sample test of
  Jitkrittum et al., 2016 (NIPS 2016). The code (`freqopttest` Python package)
  can be found [here](https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test).
